# Stone-Paper-Scissors-Project


You may have played rock paper scissors before. Maybe you’ve used it to decide who pays for dinner or who gets first choice of players for a team.

If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:

#Rock smashes scissors.

#Paper covers rock.

#Scissors cut paper.



Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how they might translate to Python code.
So I have designed this project such a way that you can play with your opponent(Computer) when you are feeling bore alone.In this project I have used conditional expression(If, Else & Elif Statement). So this is a very simple & interesting Project.
